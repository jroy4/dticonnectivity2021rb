The code in this repository comprises post-processing analysis and graphing of results related to the differences in DTI connectivity between children with cardiac arrest and neurotypical children. Please note that no clinical data is provided to execute these notebooks. They are intended solely as a reference for understanding the analysis and visualization techniques used in the study. 

The input data were the FA, MD, AD, and RD of several select white matter tracts comprising the limbic system of the brain among others. The data was in .csv format. Several of these notebooks are/were deprecated as the methods and results evolved through the study.

The associated paper where SOME of the resulting figures and analyses were published:

Jarvis JM, Roy J, Schmithorst V, Lee V, Devine D, Meyers B, Munjal N, Clark RSB, Kochanek PM, Panigrahy A, Ceschin R, Fink EL. Limbic pathway vulnerability associates with neurologic outcome in children after cardiac arrest. Resuscitation. 2023 Jan;182:109634. doi: 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2022.10.026. Epub 2022 Nov 3.
