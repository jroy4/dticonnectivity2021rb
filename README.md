This repository contains code for post-processing analysis and graphing of results related to differences in DTI connectivity between children with cardiac arrest and their respective outcomes. Please note that no clinical data is provided to execute these notebooks; they are intended solely as a reference for understanding the analysis and visualization techniques used in the study.

## Overview
The input data consisted of Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), Axial Diffusivity (AD), and Radial Diffusivity (RD) measurements from several selected white matter tracts, primarily those comprising the limbic system of the brain. These tract measurements were calculated using DSI Studio with DTIs acquired by the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. The input data was in .csv format. Note that several of these notebooks are or were deprecated as the methods and results evolved throughout the study.

Some of the resulting figures and analyses were published in the following paper:
